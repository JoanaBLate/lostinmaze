Lost In Maze is a 2.5D game (RPG style) that runs in the browser.
It is a set of episodes (more to come).
The game runs at 30 FPS, avoiding stressing the hardware - although it is very efficient: in Chrome, each loop takes only 1 ms. 
Sounds and music: currently only music (at success or failure of each mission).

No external library was used.
